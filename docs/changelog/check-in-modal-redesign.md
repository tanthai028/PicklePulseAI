Redesigned the daily check-in experience to be more mobile-friendly and intuitive. Moved from an inline card to a modal-based approach with improved UX.

## Changes

### Mobile Experience

- Added sticky footer button labeled "Check-in" on mobile
- Button shows "âœ“ Checked In" when completed

### Modal Design
- Centered dialog box with blurred background
- Responsive sizing:
  - Mobile: Comfortable margins on all sides
  - Desktop: Larger margins with `2xl` size
- Added proper spacing and padding (24px on all sides)
- Sticky "Complete Check-in" button at bottom of modal

### Slider Improvements
- Changed scale from 1-10 to 1-5 for all metrics except sleep
- Added color-coded feedback:
  - Green: Excellent (80-100%)
  - Yellow: Good (60-79%)
